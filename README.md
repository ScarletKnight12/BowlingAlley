## Description:
A chance demo of the bowling simulation application to a big name gaming corporation gave raise to
discussions about the possibility of making the existing Bowling Simulation application as a VR based
application. As a result, as part of UNIT 3 project, the teams have been tasked with rebuilding the existing
project in UNITY which is used for developing VR and Web 3D Products. You are expected to work with
your new teams and deliver the application within the given timeline.
As part of this project, you will design and develop a virtual reality scene. As part of the design process –
each member of the team will use VR Sketch sheets (provided under resources) to design the overall layout
of a VR Scene individually and later collate your ideas to finalize the overall design of the VR Scene. As
part of development, you will have to use assets related to your VR Scene from the UNITY Asset store and
develop the end-to-end scene.
The client would like you to be at your best with respect to creating the Scene designs !!! While functionality
is important, the client would like you to ensure the interaction between the game players and the system is
focused upon. So, the more creative/simple your interaction designs are the better your chances are to get
your project accepted as part of the companies wide list of games.

## Functionalities:

1. Create a simple single user – first person bowling alley game. Make use the assets like
Pins, Bowl etc. from UNITY asset store.
2. The participant user should have 10 attempts to reach the end of the game
3. There should be able maintain score board for the single user. 
4. Maintain Top score details for the last 10 games 
5. Create a Home Menu to enter and exit game 
6. Include at least one audio effect in the entire VR Scene
